GPUVerify is a static analyser for GPGPU Kernels that supports OpenCL and CUDA.

The documentation for this tool is written using Sphinx and can be found in
"Documentation/".

To generate the documentation run

$ cd Documentation
$ make html

You can then open "Documentation/_build/html/index.html" in your favourite web
browser.

If you don't have Sphinx installed you can still read the .rst files as they are
reasonably easy to read.
