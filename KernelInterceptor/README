To use, include cl_hooks.h to any files that call OpenCL host functions, **after** the OpenCL header includes (e.g., CL/cl.h, OpenCL/opencl.h).
For example,

	#include <math.h>
	#include <CL/cl.h>
	#include "parboil.h"
	#include "OpenCL_common.h"
	#include "config.h"
	#include "cl_hooks.h"

I've generally put it as the last #include, but that's probably not strictly necessary.

It will then dump, every time a kernel is run, that kernel's source, command-line options, group sizes and group counts, as well as the name of the kernel and a long string of kernel parameters.
Most of the parameters will be ignorable, being pointers to handles to buffers, but the ones that correspond to scalars are the values being passed in.

I daren't consider its thread safety or lack thereof.
Something for later?
